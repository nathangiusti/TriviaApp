# Trivia App Build Plan

## Overview
Building a real-time trivia webapp with Python backend and JavaScript frontend, allowing teams to compete in trivia games hosted by an admin.

## Architecture Components

### Backend (Python)
- **Flask/FastAPI** web server with WebSocket support
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL** for game state and team data
- **CSV parser** for question loading
- **Real-time communication** via WebSockets

### Frontend (JavaScript)
- **Vanilla JS or React** for UI components
- **WebSocket client** for real-time updates
- **Responsive design** for multiple device support

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Systems
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize Python virtual environment
   - Setup Flask/FastAPI with WebSocket support
   - Create basic project structure
   - Setup testing framework (pytest)

2. **CSV Question Management**
   - CSV parser to load questions/answers
   - Question data model and validation
   - Game-to-CSV mapping system
   - **Test**: Unit tests for CSV parsing and data validation

3. **Core Game State**
   - Game session management
   - Team registration system
   - Score tracking and persistence
   - **Test**: Unit tests for game state transitions

### Phase 2: Communication & Authentication
4. **WebSocket System**
   - Real-time bidirectional communication
   - Event-based message system (join, answer, score_update)
   - Connection management and error handling
   - **Test**: WebSocket connection and message flow tests

5. **Team Management**
   - Team registration with game ID validation
   - Duplicate team name prevention
   - Team list broadcasting
   - **Test**: Team registration edge cases

6. **Admin Authentication**
   - Password-based admin login
   - Game ID verification for hosts
   - Session management
   - **Test**: Authentication flow and security tests

### Phase 3: Game Flow & UI
7. **Question Flow System**
   - Question display logic
   - Answer submission handling
   - Question closing and reveal system
   - **Test**: Complete question lifecycle tests

8. **Scoring System**
   - Answer validation and scoring
   - Real-time leaderboard updates
   - Score persistence
   - **Test**: Scoring accuracy and edge cases

9. **Host Control Panel**
   - Admin dashboard with team list
   - Start game functionality
   - Question progression controls
   - Answer review and scoring interface
   - **Test**: Host control flow tests

10. **Frontend Components**
    - Player home page and game joining
    - Waiting room with team list
    - Question display and answer submission
    - Score display and leaderboard
    - Admin login and control panel
    - **Test**: UI component and interaction tests

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
11. **Unit Tests**
    - All backend logic components
    - Frontend utility functions
    - Data validation and error handling

12. **Integration Tests**
    - End-to-end game flow
    - WebSocket communication
    - Database operations
    - Multi-user scenarios

13. **System Tests**
    - Full game simulation
    - Load testing with multiple teams
    - Error recovery scenarios
    - Cross-browser compatibility

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Backend**: pytest for all Python modules
- **Frontend**: Jest for JavaScript functions
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage

### Integration Testing
- **API Testing**: Test all endpoints and WebSocket events
- **Database Testing**: Verify data persistence and retrieval
- **Session Testing**: Multi-user game scenarios

### End-to-End Testing
- **Selenium/Playwright**: Full user workflow testing
- **Load Testing**: Multiple concurrent games
- **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, invalid inputs
